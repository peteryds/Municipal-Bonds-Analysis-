# Municipal-Bonds-Analysis-
This project builds a normalized municipal bond database integrating issuers, bonds, ratings, trades, and state-level economic indicators. Using advanced SQL (window functions, ranking, CTEs, cumulative metrics), we analyze yield behavior, sector patterns, rating stability, trading dynamics, and political overlays.
